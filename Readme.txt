Really basic sample app to get things started

To run (assuming node.js installed)

    npm install
    npm install -g grunt-cli (if required)
    grunt build (this will install bower dependencies and attempt to build single js and css file


then use nodemon or node and run in your console:
nodemon express.js

This will open up the server at localhost:3000.

To reach the app, type in your browser:
http://localhost:3000

To access prod version
http://localhost:3000?prod=true
